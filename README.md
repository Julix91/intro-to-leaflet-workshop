## What is Leaflet?
What exactly is leaflet? Leaflet is a set of instructions that your web browser or mobile device uses to display maps and let you interact with them. So like when you double click a mouse on a map, leaflet tells your browser to zoom in. Leaflet defines the style of your map - and includes things like zoom controls, attribution links, colors for markers on top of the map, etc. It is made up of only 38kb of Javascript, so it is really fast and lightweight - meaning browsers don’t have to work very hard to load it. It is open source, free, and hugely customizable. And because of all of that it is really widely used. There are lots of alternative to Leaflet, but I think the one that is most widely used is Google Maps, which you need an API key to use.
### As Code
### In a Browser
Here is a basic leaflet example. You can zoom in, pan around, ext. It sits in your browser and loads quickly. And if we wanted to we could easily customize it.

<iframe style="width:100%; height:500px;" src="maps/map01.html"></iframe>
