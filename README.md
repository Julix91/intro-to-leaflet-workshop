This workshop is meant to be a starting point for anyone wanting to start making webmaps.
Things that would be good to know before jumping right in (but you can do this after the workshop too!):
HTML / CSS
Javascript
Cartographic design principals
Static web content

There is no prerequisite for this workshop

## What is Leaflet?
What exactly is leaflet? Leaflet is a set of instructions that your web browser or mobile device uses to display maps and let you interact with them. So like when you double click a mouse on a map, leaflet tells your browser to zoom in. Leaflet defines the style of your map - and includes things like zoom controls, attribution links, colors for markers on top of the map, etc. It is made up of only 38kb of Javascript, so it is really fast and lightweight - meaning browsers don’t have to work very hard to load it. It is open source, free, and hugely customizable. And because of all of that it is really widely used. There are lots of alternative to Leaflet, but I think the one that is most widely used is Google Maps, which you need an API key to use.
### As Code
Take a look at Leaflet.js co
### In a Browser
Here is a basic leaflet example. You can zoom in, pan around, ext. It sits in your browser and loads quickly. And if we wanted to we could easily customize it.

## Basic Structure 
### Map Tiles
### Zoom Levels
### Tile Servers
### Raster and Vector Tiles
### Data (.SHP ⇢ .GeoJSON)
### Style
### Interaction
